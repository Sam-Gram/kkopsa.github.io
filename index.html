	<p>
		In January 2012, I started my career as a software developer when I took
		my first programming class at BYU-Idaho while initially pursuing an
		Electrical Engineering degree. I realized quickly that I liked 
		high-level programming languages much more than low-level circuit
		diagrams.
	<p>	
		Since then, I have grown to love programming and software development
		even more.
	<p>	
		Throughout my education, I held a couple of different positions. Firstly,
		I worked in software quality assurance as a tester for Surge&trade;, a
		custom
		software development and consulting company. I gained experience as in 
		software development methodology as well as technical knowledge of
		testing web and mobile applications.
	<p>	
		Afterwards I continued my schooling for a few more semesters and later
		became a mobile developer for the same company. I gained experience
		with both Android and iOS mobile platforms.
	<p>	
		Now, I am coming to the close of my formal education, and I have drawn
		a couple conclusions from my experiences. I love the world of mobile
		applications and their potential throughout the world. I love the idea of
		helping developing countries utilize this technology that has literally
		been placed in the hands of billions around the globe.
	<p>	
		It is my dream to further mobile technology as a means to help developing
		countries throughout the world.
